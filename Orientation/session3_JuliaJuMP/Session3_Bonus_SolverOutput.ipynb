    "# Working with MIO Solvers\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the simple knapsack problem. Iain wants to carry items to the pawn shop to get some extra cash. He has $N$ items, each with a weight $w_i$ and a price $p_i$. Iain hasn't been to the gym lately, so he can only carry $C$ kilos. How does he choose what to bring with him?\n",
    "\n",
    "To model this as an optimization problem we'll need _binary_ decision variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{ if Iain takes item $i$,} \\\\ 0 &\\text{ if Iain does not take item $i$.}\\end{cases}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need an optimization model to decide which $x$'s should be 1 and which should be 0. We can model this as an integer optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\max& \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i x_i \\\\\n",
    "\\text{s.t.}& \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i x_i \\leq C \\\\\n",
    "& x_i \\in \\{0,1\\} \\quad \\forall i = 1,\\ldots,N\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you solve this? The simple way is just to consider each possible value for $x$ and compare the cost. After Iain has weighed all $2^N$ possible collections of items (and verified that he can lift them at once), he just chooses the best set. If $N$ is large though, this could take a while (or even forever!)\n",
    "\n",
    "A mixed-integer solver is able to solve this problem to provable optimality very fast (much faster than forever) without having to check all possible solutions. How? It explores possible solutions and keeps track of two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The best solution found so far\n",
    "* A bound on the best possible solution value\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these two pieces of information, the solver can avoid checking certain solutions if it knows they won't help.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have found a knapsack solution with value 10. We now know that we can ignore any solution if it can't go higher than 10. If the total value of all items is 20 and we have excluded more than 10 of value from the solution, we don't need to enumerate this line of solutions any further.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use MIP solvers without knowing how they work, but having some sense of what's going on inside the solver helps to understand your problem better, and especially figure out how \"difficult\" it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's solve our simple knapsack problem for Iain and see what the solver spits out."

    "# Solver parameters: Should you bother?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gurobi (and other high-quality solvers) allow you to tweak a wide range of different parameters; _sometimes_ tuning these can drastically improve performance. It can be kind of intimidating, though: Gurobi has over 100 parameters, so which are the important ones?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``OutputFlag``: set to `1` to hide all solver output\n",
    "* ``TimeLimit``: how long the solver will run before giving up\n",
    "* ``MIPGap``: stop solving when the objective is within this fraction of optimality (e.g. 0.05 means stop when within 5% of the optimal solution, the default is 0.0001 so it stops when within 0.01% of optimality)\n",
    "* ``MIPFocus``: High-level controls on solver priority (proving optimality or increasing bound or finding optimal solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "Is that it? Well, no, but you probably need domain knowledge about your problem to go much further. There's an alternative: Gurobi has a parameter tuning feature you can try to \"learn\" good parameter settings for a particular model. Try it out if you aren't quite happy with your performance.\n",
