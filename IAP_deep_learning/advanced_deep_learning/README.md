# Preassignment 4

As preassingment for session 4, we'll make sure we can open and execute a notebook in Google Colab.

Google Colab is a user interface to execute Python code. It is extremely similar to Jupyter Notebook , except that it is online and runs on GPUs, for free!

Please go to [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rmKQP4JJH3RHD2k9vsYTeM_S5nj2fM4d?usp=sharing) link and make a copy of this repository to your Google drive. For that, please follow the instructions carefully.

Then check you can execute cells as instructed, and upload a screenshot to Canvas of the requested cells.

See you on Thursday!
