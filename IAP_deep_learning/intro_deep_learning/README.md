# 15.003 IAP: Introduction to Deep Learning

This workshop is divided in 3 parts:
- Part 1: Fundamentals of Deep Learning
- Part 2: Fundamentals of Convolutional Neural Networks
- Part 2: Neural Networks Tutorial in Python using Keras

We will use a Google Colab notebook. Follow this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BNAPJtI4xYyWjVdLbOBvifao-84gx2o0?usp=sharing) to open the notebook. After that, please save a copy in your own drive so you can follow the class and make modifications.
We suggest to run a few cells before hand to make sure the notebook compiles on your browser.
